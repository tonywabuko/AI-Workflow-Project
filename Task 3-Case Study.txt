Case Study: Model Selection and Deployment for Hospital Data
Model Selection
For predicting patient readmission risk within 30 days, a tree-based classifier like XGBoost balances performance and interpretability.
XGBoost handles nonlinear relationships and missing values common in EHR data without extensive preprocessing.
Feature importance scores help clinicians understand drivers of readmission, aiding trust and acceptance.

Confusion Matrix and Metrics
Below is a confusion matrix for a test set of 1,000 patients, where “Positive” means predicted high readmission risk.

|                    | Actual Positive| Actual Negative | Total   | 
| Predicted Positive | 120 (True Pos) | 30 (False Pos) | 150    | 
| Predicted Negative | 40 (False Neg) | 810 (True Neg) | 850    | 
| Total              | 160            | 840            | 1,000  | 


Precision measures how many predicted high-risk patients truly return:
Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 120 / (120 + 30) = 0.80
Recall measures how many true readmissions we caught:
Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 120 / (120 + 40) = 0.75

Deployment Steps
- Data Pipeline and Preprocessing
- Ingest de-identified EHR extracts via secure APIs.
- Apply consistent feature transformations in a reproducible pipeline.
- Model Containerization
- Package XGBoost model and preprocessing code into a Docker container.
- Include environment specs for dependencies.
- Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
- Automate testing of new model versions on hold-out data.
- Deploy containers to a managed Kubernetes cluster in the hospital’s private cloud.
- Integration with Clinical Systems
- Expose a gRPC or REST endpoint within the hospital network.
- Ensure low-latency responses to feed risk scores into EHR dashboards.
- Monitoring and Maintenance
- Track data drift, latency, and error rates with Prometheus and Grafana.
- Trigger alerts when model performance changes or data schema shifts.

Regulatory Compliance (HIPAA)
All deployment activities must adhere to HIPAA’s Privacy and Security Rules.
- Data Encryption
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit using AES-256 and TLS 1.2+.
- Access Control
- Enforce role-based access with multi-factor authentication for clinicians and IT staff.
- Audit Logging
- Record every API call, user action, and model inference for forensic review.
- Business Associate Agreements
- Sign BAAs with any cloud or third-party vendors handling Protected Health Information.
- Staff Training
- Provide annual HIPAA security awareness training for developers and operators.

Next Steps and Further Considerations
In addition to the above, consider:
- Explainability tools (SHAP or LIME) for case-by-case risk explanations.
- Regular model retraining to accommodate changes in patient demographics or treatment protocols.
- Integrating patient consent management for secondary use of data.
- Conducting bias audits to ensure equitable performance across patient subgroups.
