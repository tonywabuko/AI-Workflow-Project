1. Short Reflection: Hardest Part of the Workflow
The most challenging phase was Data Strategy & Preprocessing for the hospital case study. Key reasons:

Data Fragmentation & Privacy: Hospital data is siloed across departments (EMR, labs, imaging), requiring complex integration while adhering to HIPAA. Anonymizing data without losing critical features (e.g., patient demographics for bias analysis) was nontrivial.

Class Imbalance: Medical datasets often have rare outcomes (e.g., sepsis onset). Oversampling minority classes risked overfitting; undersampling sacrificed crucial patterns.

Ethical Trade-Offs: Balancing model accuracy with fairness (e.g., ensuring low false negatives for high-risk patients) conflicted with resource constraints (e.g., alert fatigue for clinicians).

2. Suggested Improvements (Given More Time/Resources)
Synthetic Data Generation: Use GANs to create realistic, privacy-compliant training data for rare conditions.

Bias Auditing Pipeline: Integrate tools like AI Fairness 360 to proactively detect demographic skews during preprocessing.

Model Interpretability: Deploy SHAP/LIME alongside the model to explain predictions to clinicians (e.g., "The model flagged sepsis due to elevated lactate + low BP").

Cloud-Based MLOps: Use AWS SageMaker/Azure ML for automated retraining when data drift is detected (e.g., new lab test protocols).
