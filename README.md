# 🧠 AI Development Workflow – Group Project (Week 5)

This project demonstrates the AI Development Workflow through various tasks designed to test our understanding of building, evaluating, and deploying AI systems with real-world relevance. Our main case study explores **Student Failure Prediction** and **Hospital Readmission Risk**, supported by ethical reflection and implementation.

## 📌 Task Highlights

### 🔷 Task 1 – Student Failure Prediction
- Defined an AI problem: Predicting student dropout risk
- Used a student dataset for preprocessing and modeling
- Trained a Random Forest classifier and evaluated performance
- Reflected on workflow challenges and visualized the process

### 🔶 Task 2 – Independent Project
- Explored a secondary AI use case and followed full workflow stages

### 🔷 Task 3 – Hospital Readmission Case
- Proposed AI system to predict 30-day readmission risk
- Addressed data sourcing, privacy, and fairness concerns
- Developed confusion matrix and model evaluation metrics

### 🔶 Task 4 – Critical Thinking
- Reflected on how bias impacts outcomes
- Weighed trade-offs between model accuracy and interpretability

### 🔷 Task 5 – Reflection & Improvements
- Identified hardest workflow step: Data strategy and ethics
- Proposed tools like SHAP, AI Fairness 360, and MLOps via AWS
- Visualized a hospital-specific AI pipeline
