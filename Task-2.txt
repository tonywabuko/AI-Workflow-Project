ðŸ”¹ 1. Problem Definition (5 points)  
Problem:  
There is a high rate of re-admission (within 30 days) in hospitals, leading to increased total cost of care, lower patient outcomes, and potential penalties from health insurers/government.  

Goal:  
To improve the problem, by building an AI model that predicts if a patient (that has just been discharged) is at high risk of being re-admitted within 30 days, so actions can be taken with that patient prior to being discharged.  

Stakeholders:  
Hospital administration (reducing costs/penalties)  

Medical staff (take actions ahead of patient discharge)  

Patients (increase patient outcome as a result of fewer re-admissions)  

IT department (integration into existing system)  

Legal/compliance team (regulation)  

ðŸ”¹ 2. Data Strategy (10 points)  
a) Data Sources  
Electronic Health Records (EHR):  
ICD diagnosis codes  

Vital signs/lab results  

Length of stay, prior admissions  

Drugs prescribed  

Demographics:  
Age, gender, race  

Insurance, ZIP code  

Social Determinants of Health (optional):  
Housing, employment, support of family  

b) Ethical Considerations  
Patient Privacy:  
Sensitive health data must be de-identified and encrypted; must comply with HIPAA (USA) or similar.  

Bias in Data:  
AI models may replicate historical biases in care delivery (for example, by race or type of insurance), and thus reinforce systemic disparities.  

c)  Preprocessing Pipeline  
Step 1: Data Cleaning  
Remove duplicates and prepare missing data. Use mean imputing for labs, and Unknown for categorical.  

Step 2: Feature Engineering  
Find comorbidity scores (i.e., Charlson Index)  

Time since last admission  

Number of medications   

Binary flag - discharged to
